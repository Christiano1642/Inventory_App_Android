# Smart Inventory Manager

## Overview
Smart Inventory Manager is a mobile application designed to help users efficiently track and manage their inventory. The app allows users to add, update, delete, and view inventory items while providing SMS notifications for low-stock alerts. This project demonstrates expertise in mobile app development, user-centered design, database management, and Android permissions handling.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration functionality.
- **Inventory Management:** CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for inventory items.
- **SQLite Database Integration:** Persistent local storage for user and inventory data.
- **SMS Notifications:** Alerts for low stock levels (requires user permission).
- **Responsive UI:** Designed for ease of use and efficiency.

## Requirements and Goals
This app was developed to address the need for **efficient inventory tracking** for individuals and small businesses. The goal was to create an intuitive interface that simplifies inventory management while incorporating essential features such as SMS notifications for low stock alerts.

## User-Centered UI Design
The app's UI was developed based on user experience best practices, ensuring:
- **Simple navigation and intuitive design** to improve usability.
- **Clear data presentation** using a structured grid layout.
- **Minimal user input effort** for faster inventory updates.
- **Permission transparency**, ensuring users control SMS notifications.

## Development Approach
The development process followed these key strategies:
- **Agile methodology** with iterative improvements based on testing.
- **Separation of concerns** with modularized code for UI, database, and logic.
- **Continuous testing** using Android Emulator and real devices to verify functionality.
- **Version control** with GitHub to track changes and maintain stability.

## Testing & Debugging
The app was thoroughly tested to ensure:
- **Login & Registration workflows** function correctly.
- **Inventory CRUD operations** work without data loss.
- **SMS notifications trigger only with granted permissions.**
- **Performance optimizations** prevent UI lag and crashes.

Testing revealed critical improvements, including database query optimization and refined permission handling, to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Challenges & Innovations
One of the main challenges was implementing **SMS permissions** in a way that doesn't disrupt the app's core functionality. The solution involved **runtime permission requests**, ensuring users can deny permissions without affecting inventory management. Another innovation was optimizing the SQLite database to handle larger datasets efficiently.

## Notable Achievements
This project showcases strong technical skills in **Android development, SQLite database integration, user-centered UI design, and permission handling.** The successful implementation of SMS notifications highlights knowledge in working with **Android system services and user privacy best practices.**
